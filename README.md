# Angular Webpack Seed

A starter project for AngularJS 1.5.x using webpack and ES2015.

This project is meant to provide the same utility as the official [Angular Seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) project, while adding [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to the mix for ES2015 support.

## Installation
```npm install```

## Usage
```npm run build``` - Builds the source  
```npm run watch``` - Builds the source and rebuilds when changes are detected

## Production Build
```NODE_ENV=production npm run build``` - The webpack build is aware of the NODE_ENV and will build the production optimized source when the NODE_ENV is set to production.

## Running Tests
```npm run test``` - Runs the tests on the command line in PhantomJS headless browser
